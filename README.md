# python-sas-data-analysis

This project analyzes activity and expansion opportunities of an online travel platform using Python and SAS. It covers data manipulation, cleaning, and aggregation in Python (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, CSV handling, merging, descriptive statistics, and visualizations) and SAS programming (data import, conditional and iterative processing, statistical procedures, regression, ANOVA, and correlation analysis). The project demonstrates how Python and SAS can be combined for comprehensive data analysis and reporting.
